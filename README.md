# The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp

## Introduction
Welcome to my project!

The purpose of this project is to share my notes, annotations, tips, and, most importantly, my progress in this course. I purchased this course a couple of years ago but never finished it. Now, I want to revisit it with a professional approach as a Full Stack Developer, reviewing everything from the basics to acquiring new knowledge.

The goal is to upload content daily along with my progress.

I hope this documentation will be helpful not only for myself but also for others who are on a similar learning journey. Let's embark on this journey together!

Happy coding!
